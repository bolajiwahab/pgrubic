class TimestampColumnWithoutSuffix(linter.BaseChecker):
    """## **What it does**
    Checks that timestamp columns are suffixed with `_at`.

    ## **Why not?**
    Adding `_at` to a timestamp column name makes it clear that the value represents the
    time when something happened. For example, `created_at` indicates the time when a
    record was created, and `updated_at` indicates the time when a record was last
    updated.

    Timestamp columns could easily be confused with other types of data if not clearly
    named. For example, a column named created might be unclear â€” does it represent a
    boolean flag, a date, or something else? `created_at` removes this ambiguity by
    specifying that it's a timestamp.

    ## **When should you?**
    Almost Never.

    ## **Use instead:**
    Add `_at` suffix to the timestamp column name.
