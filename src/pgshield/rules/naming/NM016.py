class DateColumnWithoutSuffix(linter.Checker):
    """## **What it does**
    Checks that date columns are suffixed with `_date`.

    ## **Why not?**
    Adding `_date` to a date column name makes it clear that the value represents the
    date when something happened. For example, `created_date` indicates the date when a
    record was created, and `updated_date` indicates the date when a record was last
    updated.

    Date columns could easily be confused with other types of data if not clearly
    named. For example, a column named created might be unclear â€” does it represent a
    boolean flag, a date, or something else? `created_date` removes this ambiguity by
    specifying that it's a date.

    ## **When should you?**
    Almost Never.

    ## **Use instead:**
    Add `_date` suffix to the date column name.
