# column that has date should be typed date?

# we cannot use format {table}_{columns(s)}_idx because postgres only allow 63 characters by default in identifiers
# e.g in indexname where we are expecting table name and column name, if postgres truncates the identifier
# then our checks will be flawed, best effort is to use regex to ensure format but no further checks on table
# and column name
# columns: str = ("_").join(stream.RawStream()(node.indexParams).split("; "))

-- include-convention as an arg (if your service is compliant then enable this to prevent future uncompliance hence no need)
enable once service is rfc compliant
-- mode -- strict/changed -- strict scans all source files, changed uses git to get changed files

-- update : enable convention by default with default config, since we are following postgres normal conventions
-- best practices, people can disable convention by default

-- Don't use CURRENT_TIME

-- schema-qualified custom type

--*** turn everything into keywords args

-- schemas.partitions []
-- schemas.tables[] -- not supported
