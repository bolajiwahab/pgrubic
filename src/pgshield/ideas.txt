# blacklist config e.g types e.g bool etc

# add format for exclusion constraint

# prevent missing rule numbers

# config to exclude certain files from the check e.g init.sql - should happen at the source file registration to skip

-- include-convention as an arg (if your service is compliant then enable this to prevent future uncompliance hence no need)
enable once service is rfc compliant
-- support exclude files (files to exclude)
-- mode -- strict/changed -- strict scans all source files, changed uses git to get changed files

-- update : enable convention by default with default config, since we are following postgres normal conventions
-- best practices, people can disable convention by default

-- Don't use CURRENT_TIME

-- schema-qualified custom type

--*** turn everything into keywords args

-- schemas.partitions []
-- schemas.tables[] -- not supported

-- if identifier starts with pg_
