    Checks for replace in view creation.

    ## **Why not?**
    `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` simplifies the process of modifying existing functions,
    as you don't need to manually drop and recreate them.

    If you drop and then recreate a view, the new view is not the same entity as
    the old; you will have to drop existing rules, views, triggers, etc. that refer to the
    old view. Use CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW to change a view definition without
    breaking objects that refer to the view. It also maintains data integrity and
    consistency.

    ## **When should you?**
    If you don't need to modify an existing view.

    ## **Use instead:**
    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW.
