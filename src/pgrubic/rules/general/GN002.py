    Checks for creation of rules.

    ## **Why not?**
    Rules are incredibly powerful, but they don't do what they look like they do.
    They look like they're some conditional logic, but they actually rewrite a query
    to modify it or add additional queries to it.

    ## **When should you?**
    Never. While the rewriter is an implementation detail of VIEWs,
    there is no reason to pry up this cover plate directly.

    ## **Use instead:**
    Don't use rules. If you think you want to, use a trigger instead.
